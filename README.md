 Spot Savy â€“ Smart Parking System
Spot Savy is a smart parking system designed using ESP32 that monitors the availability of parking slots and displays the status via a local web server. It integrates sensors, a servo motor for gate control, and safety features like flame detection and buzzer alerts.

Features:
Real-time Parking Slot Monitoring (5 slots)

Wi-Fi Web Interface (ESP32 hosted)

Automatic Gate Control via Servo Motor

Flame Detection with Alert Buzzer

Visual Indicators with LEDs

OLED Display for network credentials and IP

Manual Alert Button for emergencies

Hardware Components:
ESP32 Development Board

IR Sensors (6x) â€“ For slot detection and entry gate

OLED Display (SSD1306)

Servo Motor (for gate control)

Flame Sensor

Buzzer

LEDs (5x)

Push Button

Network Configuration:
SSID: Rohilla

Password: 87654321

System displays local IP on OLED after connection.

Web Interface:
Access the smart parking dashboard via the IP shown on the OLED. The web UI displays:

Slot status (P = Parked, E = Empty):

ON/OFF control for each slot simulation

Buzzer and Servo controls

Setup:
Flash the code to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.

Power up the system and wait for it to connect to Wi-Fi.

Note the IP address on the OLED screen.

Open the IP in a browser to access the interface.
